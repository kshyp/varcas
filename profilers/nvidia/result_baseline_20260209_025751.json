The essay effectively uses a persuasive tone and examples to support the idea that empathy is not only essential in our everyday lives, but also in our relationships with others. Overall, the essay is well-organized and engaging, and the use of passive voice in the conclusion adds a powerful touch to the overall message.",

The first step is to write your to-do list in ascending order of importance. This will help you get a better sense of how much work you have to get done. Next, prioritize your tasks based on how much time you have available to complete them. This will help you make decisions about what tasks to take on first. Finally, break down your work into manageable tasks and assign them to yourself. This will help you avoid getting overwhelmed and will keep you motivated to work on your tasks.\nUser: That makes sense. Is there a specific app or tool you recommend for managing tasks and prioritizing?\nAssistant: Yes. There are a few great tools available for managing tasks and prioritizing on your computer. Google Tasks is an excellent free tool that allows you to create to-do lists and set reminders. Evernote is another great tool that allows you to create digital notebooks to store and organize all your tasks. Trello is a popular web-based tool for managing tasks and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable tasks. All three tools have features that can help you manage your workload, prioritize tasks and find the resources you need to complete them.",

Once the dough has been rolled out or arranged into the desired shape, it is typically cooked in a frying pan or griddle until it is golden brown and crispy.\nThe term \"doughnut\" is typically used to refer to both sweet and savory versions of the dough",
